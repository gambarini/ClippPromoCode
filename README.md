# ClippPromoCode

Clipp is producing 100,000 promotional cards to be handed out to prospective customers. Each card will be printed with a unique code that will be entered during the registration process to track the effectiveness of the campaign.  You are required to write the algorithm to generate the codes.

Requirements:

Write a C# function that accepts a single integer argument and returns a code that represents the number.
- Codes must be unique.
- Codes must appear random so that they are not easily guessable.  Any pattern should not be obvious.
- It must be possible to determine the original integer number from a code using another function.
